<p>This is all about me.</p>
<p>
    I am currently in my senior year at Ohio University where I am studying Management Information Systems and Business Analytics. I am from Concord
    Ohio which is about 30 min east of Cleveland. In the future I hope to become the CIO of a large company and benefit my business through data driven decisions.
